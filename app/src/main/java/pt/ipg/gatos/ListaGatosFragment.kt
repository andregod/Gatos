     * transactions while in this call, since it can happen after an
     * activity's state is saved.  See [ FragmentManager.openTransaction()][androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManager.beginTransaction] for further discussion on this.
     *
     *
     * This function is guaranteed to be called prior to the release of
     * the last data that was supplied for this Loader.  At this point
     * you should remove all use of the old data (since it will be released
     * soon), but should not do your own release of the data since its Loader
     * owns it and will take care of that.  The Loader will take care of
     * management of its data so you don't have to.  In particular:
     *
     *
     *  *
     *
     *The Loader will monitor for changes to the data, and report
     * them to you through new calls here.  You should not monitor the
     * data yourself.  For example, if the data is a [android.database.Cursor]
     * and you place it in a [android.widget.CursorAdapter], use
     * the [android.widget.CursorAdapter.CursorAdapter] constructor *without* passing
     * in either [android.widget.CursorAdapter.FLAG_AUTO_REQUERY]
     * or [android.widget.CursorAdapter.FLAG_REGISTER_CONTENT_OBSERVER]
     * (that is, use 0 for the flags argument).  This prevents the CursorAdapter
     * from doing its own observing of the Cursor, which is not needed since
     * when a change happens you will get a new Cursor throw another call
     * here.
     *  *  The Loader will release the data once it knows the application
     * is no longer using it.  For example, if the data is
     * a [android.database.Cursor] from a [android.content.CursorLoader],
     * you should not call close() on it yourself.  If the Cursor is being placed in a
     * [android.widget.CursorAdapter], you should use the
     * [android.widget.CursorAdapter.swapCursor]
     * method so that the old Cursor is not closed.
     *
     *
     *
     * This will always be called from the process's main thread.
     *
     * @param loader The Loader that has finished.
     * @param data The data generated by the Loader.
